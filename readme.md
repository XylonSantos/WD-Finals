## Overview

Description of the project in details.

The project is a personal website designed and developed as a Final Project for Web Design by Xylon Nicholas N. Santos from TW04. The website showcases my skills, experience, and various projects through multiple pages. The purpose of this project is to create an online portfolio that highlights the developer's capabilities in web design and development. It aims to present a professional image, showcase completed projects, and provide an overview of the developer's skills and experiences to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. The Key Components: Contains navigation links to different sections of the website, such as HOME, ABOUT ME, PROJECTS, OVERVIEW, GALLERY, and CONTACT. Features a background video and a welcome message, creating an engaging introduction to the website. Provides detailed information about skills, experience, and education.  Displays past projects with titles, repository links, and descriptions. Gives an overview of the website's purpose and content. Features a hero gallery showcasing various characters and elements. Includes contact information and links to social media profiles. The structure of the website is built using HTML. It defines the layout and content of each page, including sections, navigation, and media elements. CSS is used to style the website, providing visual enhancements and ensuring a responsive design. Key styles include flexbox for layout, animations for interactive elements, and transitions for smooth user experiences. Images, videos, and icons are used throughout the website to enhance the visual appeal and provide relevant content.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
